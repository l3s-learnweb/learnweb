                    In order to use the system it is necessary to provide some personal data. <br/>
                    The legal basis for the processing of personal data is the consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a), Art. 7 Basic Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO).
                    Below is a list of all personal data stored in the database during the use of Learnweb and the reason for storage or processing.

                        In order to provide and improve its functionality, Learnweb needs to record general user actions such as login and logout, but especially actions
                        that occur when dealing with resources and groups. This includes creating, editing, viewing, commenting and searching, but also any other actions
                        that can be applied to resources and groups. It is stored in each case which user, at which time, which action has executed. This serves to ensure
                        the traceability of changes. The information is also used to notify users of changes to their groups and resources.

                        Your course is part of a research project for which it is necessary to collect further usage statistics.
                        If individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:

                    or upon request by the user. The data in the Learnweb system is backed up at regular intervals (usually daily) and remains there for a period of 60 days.

            <div class="c-section-text">
                <p>We embed third-party images and videos (Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, Ipernity, Bing, TED) into LearnWeb. The third party provider receives at least
                    the following information about the LearnWeb user:</p>

                <ol>

                <p>
                    Where possible, we integrate the contents in the extended data protection mode. Like most websites, however, these providers also use cookies
                    to collect information about visitors to their website. YouTube and Vimeo use these, for example, to collect video statistics, to prevent fraud and
                    to improve user-friendliness. When you start the video, it may trigger further data processing. We have no influence on that.
                    Further information on data protection can be obtained from the providers.
